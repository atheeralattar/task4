## 1. Write a C# Sharp program to check whether a given string is a valid Hex code or not. Return true if this string is a valid code otherwise false.

Sample Data:

("#CD5C5C") -> True

("#f08080") -> True

("#E9967A") -> True

("#EFFA07A") -> False

  

## 2. Write a C# Sharp program to calculate the average word length in a given string. Round the average length up to two decimal places.

Sample Data:

("CPP Exercises." -> 6

("C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn.") -> 4

(“C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language") -> 5.62

  

## 3. Write a C# Sharp program to check whether a given string of characters can be transformed into a palindrome. Return true otherwise false.

Sample Data:

("amamd") -> True

("pamamd") -> False

("ferre") -> True

  

## 4. Write a C# Sharp program to validate a password of length 7 to 16 characters with the following guidelines:

• Length between 7 and 16 characters.

• At least one lowercase letter (a-z).

• At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).

• At least one digit (0-9).

• Supported special characters: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + = _ - { } [ ] : ; " ' ? < > , .

Sample Data:

("Suuu$21g@") -> True

("W#1g@") -> False

("a&&g@") -> False

("sdsd723#$Amid") -> True

("sdsd723#$Amidkiouy") -> False

  

## 5. Write a C# Sharp program to check whether two given strings contain the same character pattern.

Sample Data:

("AACC", "PPRR") -> True

("FFGG", "ADAD") -> False

  

# 6. Write a C# Sharp program to check for repeated occurrences of words in a given string.

Sample Data:

("C# C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is is also simple and easy to to learn learn.") -> 3 matches found

("Red Green Green Black Black Green.") -> 2 matches found

  

## 7. Write a C# Sharp program to check whether a given string represents a currency value or has the correct format to represent a currency value.

  

## 8. Write a C# Sharp program to remove special characters from given text. Return the updated string which allows alphanumeric characters, spaces, underscores _ and dashes - .

Sample Data:

("AA@%^&CC") -> "AACC"

("Python") -> "Python"

("google.com") -> "googlecom"

  

## 9. Write a C# Sharp program to locate the word “C#” in a given string. If the word "C#" is found, return “C# document found.” otherwise return “Sorry no C# document!”.

Sample Data:

("C# Exercises") -> "C# document found."

("Python Exercises") -> "Sorry no C# document!"

("Tutorial on c#") -> "C# document found."
