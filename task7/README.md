1. Write a C# program to implement a stack with push and pop operations. Find the top element of the stack and check if the stack is empty or not.
  
2. Write a C# program to sort the elements of a given stack in descending order.
  
3. Write a C# program to sort the elements of a given stack in ascending order.
  
4. Write a C# program to reverse the elements of a given stack.
  
5. Write a C# program to find the maximum element in a stack.
  
6. Write a C# program to find the minimum element in a stack.
  
7. Write a C# program to remove all the elements from a given stack.
  
8. Write a C# program to remove specified element from a given stack.
  
9. Write a C# program to count all the elements in a given stack.
  
10. Write a C# program to count specified element in a given stack.
  
11. Write a C# program to implement a stack that checks if a given element is present or not in the stack.
  
12. Write a C# program to remove duplicates from a given stack.
  
13. Write a C# program to find the top and bottom elements of a given stack.
  
14. Write a C# program to rotate the stack elements to the left direction.
  
15. Write a C# program to swap the top two elements of a given stack.
  
16. Write a C# program to get the nth element from the top of the stack.
  
17. Write a C# program to merge two stacks into one.
  
18. Write a C# program that implements a stack and checks if a stack is a subset of another stack.
  
19. Write a C# program that implements a stack and checks if two stacks are equal.
  
20. Write a C# program that implements a stack and finds common elements between two stacks.
  
21. Write a C# program that implements a stack and find elements that are in the first stack but not in the second stack.
  
22. Write a C# program that implements a stack and creates a new stack that contains all elements from both stacks without duplicates.
  
23. Write a C# program that implements a stack and creates a new stack that contains only elements that are in either the first or the second stack, but not in both.
  
24. Write a C# program that implements a stack and creates a new stack from a portion of the original stack.
  
25. Write a C# program that implements a stack and checks if all elements of the stack satisfy a condition.
  
26. Write a C# program that implements a stack and checks if at least one element of the stack satisfies a condition.
  
27. Write a C# program that implements a stack and create a new stack by removing elements that do not satisfy a condition.
